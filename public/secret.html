      clearly
      defines your own convictions, desires, goals, and motivates you to be your best.</li>
    <li>Add the lang Attribute. You should always include the lang attribute inside the /html/ tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.</li>
    <li>Provide alternative content for multimedia. For multimedia, such as images, videos, animated objects via canvas, make sure to offer alternative access. For images, that means the use of meaningful alternative text (alt) and for video and audio transcripts and captions, if available.</li>
    <li>If you ever forget your WiFi password or you want to get your school WiFi password etc. Just type this command
      into the
      command line of a computer already connected to that WiFi: netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear</li>
